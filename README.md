You need to download pygame from pip in powershell or your equivalent (also make sure you have everything up to date including python).

To play the game run “One with Graphics”.

Also to make a level run the levelCreator file and the level should be in the level11.txt file. Copy and paste it into the main code’s level area and paste the name into the level array.
